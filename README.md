Just trying some things out for now.

The goal is to be able to import ogre 3d skeletons and animations into Blender and then export them back out.

I'm going to probably end up borrowing liberally from rigify and ogre scene exporter.

Once I am happy with the skeleton functionality, I will work on the mesh.
